next [????.??.??]
-----------------
* Allow building with `lens-5.*`.

1.21.4 [2021.01.29]
-------------------
* Allow building with `vector-0.12.2` or later.
* The build-type has been changed from `Custom` to `Simple`.
  To achieve this, the `doctests` test suite has been removed in favor of using
  [`cabal-docspec`](https://github.com/phadej/cabal-extras/tree/master/cabal-docspec)
  to run the doctests.

1.21.3 [2020.10.03]
-------------------
* Allow building with GHC 9.0.

1.21.2 [2020.09.30]
-------------------
* Use `base-orphans-0.8.3` or later. This means that the `Linear.Instances`
  module no longer defines any orphan instances of its own, and the module is
  now a simple shim on top of `Data.Orphans` from `base-orphans`.

1.21.1 [2020.06.25]
-------------------
* Allow building with `random-1.2.*`.

1.21 [2020.02.03]
-----------------
* Add instances for direct sums (`Product`) and tensor products (`Compose`) of
  other vector spaces. This makes is much more convenient to do things like treat
  a matrix temporarily as a vector through Compose, or to consider things like
  Gauss-Jordan elimination, which wants augmented structures.
* Add `frobenius` for computing the Frobenius norm of a matrix.
* Added `Random` instances for `System.Random`. We had an indirect dependency
  through `vector` anyways.
* Add "obvious" zipping `Semigroup` and `Monoid` instances to all the
  representable vector spaces.
* Add `R1`..`R4` instances to `Quaternion`. `_w` is the scalar component so that
  `_x`,`_y`,`_z` can be directional.
* Add more solvers to `Linear.Matrix`, available with `base-4.8` or later.
* Add `unangle` function to `Linear.V2`.

1.20.9 [2019.05.02]
-------------------
* Derive `Lift` instances for `Plucker`, `Quaternion`, and `V{0,1,2,3,4}`.

1.20.8 [2018.07.03]
-------------------
* Add instances of the `Field` classes from `lens`.
* Add `Epsilon` instance for `Complex`.
* Use specialized implementations of the `null` and `length` methods in
  `Foldable` instances.
* Add `Hashable1` instances for data types in `linear`. Also add a
  `Hashable` instance for `V`.
* Fix a bug in which `Quaternion`s were incorrectly exponentiated.

1.20.7
------
* Support `semigroupoids-5.2.1` and `doctest-0.12`

1.20.6
------
* Revamp `Setup.hs` to use `cabal-doctest`. This makes it build
  with `Cabal-2.0`, and makes the `doctest`s work with `cabal new-build` and
  sandboxes.
* Make `(1 / x)` and `recip x` agree in the `Fractional` instance for `Quaternion`
* Use newtype instances for `Point` vectors in `Linear.Affine`
* Enable `PolyKinds` in `Linear.Trace`. Also enable `PolyKinds` when GHC 7.6 or
  later is used (previously, it was GHC 7.8 or later).
* Fix a segfault arising from the `MVector` instance for `V`
* Add `Finite` class for conversion between `V` and fixed-size vector types

1.20.5
------
* GHC 8 compatibility
* Fixed the `perspective` calculation.

1.20.4
------
* Compatibility with `base-orphans` 0.5

------

* Removed the local `.ghci` file.
* Various numerical stability improvements were made to the quaternion and projection functions.

1.20.1
------
* Fixed doctests broken by the previous change.
* Unboxed vector instances for various linear data types now use unpacked integers even on older GHCs.

1.20
----
* `inv22`, `inv33` and `inv44` no longer attempt an epsilon check. They no longer return a `Maybe` result as a consequence.
  You should filter for the 0 determinant case yourself.

1.19.1.3

1.18.2
------
* Added `NFData` instance for `Point`

1.18.0.2
--------
* Fixed builds on even older GHCs.

1.16.3

------
* Added `frustum`, analogous to the old `glFrustum` call.
* Added `inverseInfinitePerspective`, `inverseOrtho`, `inverseFrustum`.

1.15.1

1.11
----

------
* Added `Linear.V2.angle`.

1.10
----
* Added `Hashable` instances.

1.9.1
